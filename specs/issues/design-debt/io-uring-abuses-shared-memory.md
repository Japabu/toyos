# Io_uring abuses shared_memory

io_uring does not share memory between processes — it shares a page between the
kernel and one userspace process. It should own its `PageAlloc` directly, map it
into the process's page tables, and store it in `IoUringInstance`; Drop frees the
pages. This also removes the only caller of `shared_memory::destroy()`.
