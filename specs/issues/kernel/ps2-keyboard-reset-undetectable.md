# A keyboard that resets behind our back is undetectable on the PS/2 wire

The i8042 driver runs the keyboard in set 2 with the controller translating to
set 1, which is Linux's default and the best-trodden EC path. The cost is that
`0xAA` — the keyboard's BAT-complete byte after a self-reset — is bit-identical
to left Shift's break code (`0x2A | 0x80`). `toyos-ps2` therefore does *not*
treat it as a reset; only `0x00`/`0xFF`, the overrun and detection-error codes,
report `Lost` and trigger `keyboard::release_all()`.

Consequence on the T14, where the EC does reset the keyboard after suspend or a
lid event: the reset is not noticed. It is survivable rather than silent
breakage — the keyboard comes back in set 2 with controller translation still
on, so the wire format is unchanged, and the `0xAA` it sends decodes as a Shift
*release*, which is accidentally the right direction for the one state that
could stick. Untested on real hardware. If it does bite, the fix is a
controller-side reconnect probe (`0xF2` identify on a timer), not a wire
heuristic, because no wire heuristic exists.
