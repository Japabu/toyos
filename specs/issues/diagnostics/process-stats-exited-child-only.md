# `SYS_PROCESS_STATS` can only report an exited direct child, once

`sys_process_stats` (`kernel/src/arch/syscall.rs:1640`) positions in
`data.child_stats` — a per-parent list, populated only when a child exits
(`kernel/src/process.rs:998`) — and `remove`s the entry it finds. So the
syscall answers exactly one question: what did my own child, which has
already exited, cost? It cannot sample a live process, cannot be differenced
across two calls, and cannot see a daemon at all.

That is the whole of layer 1's read path, and nothing said so outside
`toyos-abi/src/syscall.rs`'s doc comment. `userland/toybox`'s `stats` is a
spawn-and-measure wrapper, which is why it works. Anyone asking "where is
soundd's / the compositor's / netd's time going?" has to reach past it —
`audio_idle_suspend` pays exactly that cost, name-matching `SYS_SYSINFO`
entries into a byte buffer to sample a running daemon twice. A per-process
query on a live target is the missing piece; it is a layer-1 gap, not a
layer-2 one.
