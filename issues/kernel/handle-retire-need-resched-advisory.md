# `handle_retire`'s `need_resched` on a running target is a request the next pass may decline

`preempt_if_due` fires on quantum expiry or an RT task in the band, and on
neither for a merely-killed task — so the pass that `need_resched` asked for can
run, clear the request and resume the task, which then dies only at the real
quantum end. That is what spec §7.6 promises ("bounded by the quantum") and
`retire_task`'s spin deadline is 100 quanta, so it is conformant rather than
broken. Adding `|| current.shared().kill_pending()` to `preempt_if_due` would
make the request mean what it says, for one atomic load per pass.
