# Std leaks a whole thread stack on every `thread::spawn`

`rust/library/std/src/sys/thread/toyos.rs` allocates the stack with
`alloc::alloc` (2 MiB minimum), hands its base to `SYS_THREAD_SPAWN`, and never
records the pointer. `Thread` holds only a tid and has no `Drop`, `join` does not
free it, and the trampoline cannot — it is standing on it. So every spawned
thread costs 2 MiB of heap for the life of the process, which dlmalloc serves
from a dedicated `mmap` above its 256 KiB threshold: one leaked 2 MiB kernel
region per spawn, walking the address space downwards.

Found while testing thread-exit TLS release, where the drift swamped the signal
(the test now drives `SYS_THREAD_SPAWN` directly on a reused stack). It also
makes any per-process memory measurement across a thread-spawning workload wrong.
The fix wants the stack owned by something the joiner can free — a base/layout
pair on `Thread`, freed in `join` after the tid is reaped.
