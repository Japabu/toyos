# The fork estate is invisible to the zero-warning bar

Cargo passes `--cap-lints allow` to every package whose source is not a *path*
source. All 14 forks in `forks.toml` are consumed as git dependencies, so rustc
discards their warnings before anything can print them. Measured on `sshd`'s
graph: 140 of 143 units capped, the three exceptions being the local path crates
`sshd`, `toyos` and `toyos_abi`.

This is not a build-system defect and no build-system change can reach it. The
build system used to swallow cargo's diagnostics on success as well — that is
fixed — and the forks stayed invisible, because the cap is applied by cargo
upstream of anything `src/build.rs` does.

The trap to avoid is `[lints]` inside a fork: it is a manifest change, so it
lands in `git log <base>..toyos` and would put ToyOS lint policy into every
upstream PR the estate sends. Plan, procedure and the standing-mechanism
question: `specs/plans/fork-lint-audit-plan.md`. It needs a quiet tree, because
path-overriding the forks changes what every build in the repo resolves.
