# `percpu.syscall_rip` is never cleared, so "in syscall context" is a guess

`syscall_entry` stores the user RIP at `gs:[216]` on every SYSCALL and nothing
ever zeroes it. The panic handler's recovery predicate is `syscall_rip() != 0
&& current_tid().is_some()` (`main.rs`), so on any CPU that has ever served a
syscall the first half is permanently true. A panic in IRQ context — a timer
tick, a scheduler assert — with any task current is therefore treated as a
syscall panic: `try_recover_from_panic` poisons that task, kills the process
and rejoins the scheduler.

The consequence is backwards from fail-fast: a kernel bug with nothing to do
with the current process kills an innocent process and lets the machine run on,
instead of halting and reporting. `crash_report_panic` prints a "Syscall:
num=... user_rip=..." block off the same stale value, so the report also names
a syscall that is not running. Clearing it on syscall return is one store; the
honest predicate is a per-CPU "in syscall" depth.
